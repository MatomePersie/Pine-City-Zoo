          <h3>GIRAFFE</h3>
          <p>
            The giraffe (Giraffa camelopardalis) is an African even-toed
            ungulate mammal, the tallest living terrestrial animal and the
            largest ruminant. Its species name refers to its camel-like shape
            and its leopard-like colouring. Its chief distinguishing
            characteristics are its extremely long neck and legs, its horn-like
            ossicones, and its distinctive coat patterns. It is classified under
            the family Giraffidae, along with its closest extant relative, the
            okapi. The nine subspecies are distinguished by their coat patterns.
            The giraffe's scattered range extends from Chad in the north to
            South Africa in the south, and from Niger in the west to Somalia in
            the east. Giraffes usually inhabit savannahs, grasslands, and open
            woodlands. Their primary food source is acacia leaves, which they
            browse at heights most other herbivores cannot reach. Giraffes are
            preyed on by lions; their calves are also targeted by leopards,
            spotted hyenas, and African wild dogs. Adult giraffes do not have
            strong social bonds, though they do gather in loose aggregations if
            they happen to be moving in the same general direction. Males
            establish social hierarchies through "necking", which are combat
            bouts where the neck is used as a weapon. Dominant males gain mating
            access to females, which bear the sole responsibility for raising
            the young. WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM? You will find the giraffes at
            G15, just beyond the research centre.

            All elephants have several distinctive features, the most notable of
            which is a long trunk or proboscis, used for many purposes,
            particularly breathing, lifting water and grasping objects. Their
            incisors grow into tusks, which can serve as weapons and as tools
            for moving objects and digging. Elephants' large ear flaps help to
            control their body temperature. Their pillar-like legs can carry
            their great weight. African elephants have larger ears and concave
            backs while Asian elephants have smaller ears and convex or level
            backs.

            Elephants are herbivorous and can be found in different habitats
            including savannahs, forests, deserts and marshes. They prefer to
            stay near water.
          </p>
          <strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p></strong>
          <p>
            You will find the elephants at pen E22, right next to the
            amphitheatre.
